Mork provides automatic C bindings for Lua using ctypesgen-json and
alien. (Mork is a friendly alien. However, it cannot drink through its
fingers. Indeed, it does not have fingers. It is a shallow analogy.)
Mork is distributed under the MIT License, like Lua itself.

alien is a libffi binding for Lua: http://mascarenhas.github.com/alien/

ctypesgen-json turns C headers into JSON for use with libffi:
http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/


Usage
-----

First, turn a header file into JSON using ctypesgen-json:

$ ctypesgen.py --all-headers --builtin-symbols --output-language=json /usr/include/foo.h -o foo.json

Then in Lua, Mork slurps up the JSON and generates alien bindings on
the fly, returning a module:

require "mork"
require "json"

module = mork.bind (json.decode (io.open ("foo.json"):read ("*a")))
